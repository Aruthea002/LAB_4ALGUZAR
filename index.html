        <h2><u>Early Life</u></h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Melanie Adele Martinez</b> was born on April 28, 1995, in Astoria, Queens, to parents <b> Mery and Jose Martinez</b>, who
            are of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. Her family moved to Baldwin, New York, on Long Island, when
            Martinez was four.

            Martinez attended Plaza Elementary School, crediting her teacher Mr. Nadien with teaching her how to
            sing, and in kindergarten, Martinez began writing poetry. Martinez says she had few friends growing
            up and was a homebody,
            as she was "very emotional" and found it difficult to explain her feelings, crying when overwhelmed.
            She practiced photography and painting. Due to her emotionality as a child, she says that others referred to
            her as a "cry baby", which sparked the creation of the titular character of her debut album, Cry Baby.
            Martinez grew up in a "traditional Latin household" where she was made to feel shameful about talking about
            her sexuality and felt as if she would not be accepted if she came out as bisexual. She says that her family
            is now fully accepting of her sexuality.
            At fourteen, Martinez taught herself how to play guitar by studying chord diagrams of songs she enjoyed,
            which she found online, and wrote her first song by adding her poetry to one of the chord diagrams,
            but says that playing guitar "eventually got stale". Martinez graduated from Baldwin High School.</p>

        <H2><u>Career</u></H2>
        <h3><small>2012–2014: Breakthrough with The Voice and Dollhouse EP</small></h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In <i>2012</i>, during her junior year of high school, Martinez participated in the MSG Varsity Talent Show, a
            televised talent competition. She sang the Beatles' rendition of "Money (That's What I Want)" by Barrett
            Strong and "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" by the Four Tops. She was eliminated in the second round.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Martinez then auditioned for the third season of The Voice. She had not watched the show herself prior to the
            audition. The initial, untelevised audition was an open call, held at Javits Center. She recalls that
            while she and her mother were driving to the audition, her mother's car broke down before they reached the
            Queens–Midtown Tunnel, and the two were forced to "hitchhike" a taxicab in order to get there. Several
            months after the initial audition, while at Roosevelt Field Mall, Martinez received word that she had
            advanced to the "second round". She then received multiple callbacks until she was finally selected to
            audition on the show itself.Martinez auditioned singing Britney Spears's "Toxic" with three of the four
            judges (Adam Levine, CeeLo Green and Blake Shelton) hitting their "I Want You" button. Martinez ultimately
            chose Adam Levine to be her coach.

            In the Battle Round, Martinez competed against Caitlin Michele. They performed a duet of the Ellie Goulding
            song "Lights". Martinez won and moved on to the Knockout Round. Michele was stolen by Cee Lo Green and also
            moved on. In the Knockout Round, Martinez was paired with Sam James. She chose to sing La Roux's
            "Bulletproof". Levine eliminated James, and Martinez moved on to the Live Rounds as one of the five
            remaining members of Team Adam. In week one of the Live Rounds, Martinez sang "Hit the Road Jack". Public
            vote saved Team Adam members Amanda Brown and Bryan Keith. Levine then chose Martinez over Loren Allred and
            Joselyn Rivera to remain in the competition. In week three, Martinez's performance of "Seven Nation Army"
            finished the voting period at #10 on the iTunes Top 200 Single Chart, causing her iTunes votes to be
            multiplied by ten. This occurred again in week four, when "Too Close" ended the voting period at #6.

            Martinez was eliminated by audience vote in week five, along with the fellow Team Adam member Amanda Brown,
            leaving Levine with no artists. In response, Martinez said, "I never expected to get this far and this is
            beyond what I've ever dreamed of. I'm just so glad I got to express who I am as an artist and really touch
            people's hearts because that was the ultimate goal". </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">After the show, Martinez began working independently on original material, which she says she spent the
            majority of 2013 writing. She released her debut single, <span style="color: deepskyblue;">"Dollhouse"</span>, on February 9, 2014.
            She later compared the song's story to Edward Scissorhands, saying "[It's] the perfect home with the perfect
            lawn and they all look the same. But behind each house there's a screwed up group of people who are hiding
            behind wealth and perfection."[30] Martinez also released a music video for the track, which was fan-funded
            by an Indiegogo page created by Martinez, and hair, makeup, and shooting were all done by friends of
            hers.[10][31][32] The song was produced and cowritten by NYC songwriting duo Kinetics & One Love.[33]

            On April 7, 2014, Martinez signed to Atlantic Records and released her debut EP, Dollhouse, a month later on
            May 19, 2014. The only single from the EP, "Carousel", reached number nine on the Alternative
            Digital Songs chart, was certified gold by the RIAA, and featured in a preview for FX's miniseries American
            Horror Story: Freak Show. She promoted the EP with the Dollhouse Tour which lasted from June
            2014 to March 2015.

<section>
    <p>In May 2016, Martinez released her second EP, <span style="color: blue;">Pity Party</span> in Ireland, Mexico and the UK exclusively.[52] A month later, Martinez said she had started working on and recording her second album.

    <p>In October 2016, Martinez released a commercial for her fragrance,<i style="color: deepskyblue;"> Cry Baby Perfume Milk</i>, noting that the "idea for this perfume has been cultivating in my brain since the moment I finished writing <i>Cry Baby</i>. he perfume was directly distributed by Martinez's record label, Atlantic, making them the first record label to distribute a fragrance. Martinez also collaborated with cosmetics company Lime Crime, Inc. to release two "exclusive" lipsticks: a blue lipstick called <span style="color: deepskyblue;">"Cry Baby"</span> on August 17, 2015, and a brown lipstick called <span style="color: deepskyblue;">"Teddy Bear"</span> on March 9, 2016.

        <H2><u><Small>Music Style</Small></u></H2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Martinez's music has been describe as pop, alternative pop, art pop, electropop, and dark pop. <i>Cry
                baby</i> and <i>K-12</i> were seen to have hip-hop and R&B undertones.
            <i>Portals</i> saw Melanie venturing into experimental sounds and pop-rock. Martinez's music has been
            described by <i style="color:blue">The Guardian</i> as "off kilter, sweary electropo."
            <i>Rolling Stone</i> described Martinez's music "twisted lullabies about love, danger and madness", and
            compared her music to that of <i style="color:blue">Coin-Operated Boy</i>-era <i
                style="color: blue;">Dresden Dolls</i> and <i style="color: blue;">Lana Del Rey. The New York Times Jon
                Pareles</i> describe her music as perching prettily tinkling keybords and concise pop choruses amid the
            slow, ominous basslines and twitchy percussion of Southern hip-hop – a candy-coated variation on the dirges
            of Lorde and Lana Del Rey", and described her mezzo-soprano voice as "whispery, sardonic, tearful, [and]
            furious". <i style="color: blue;">Billboards</i> Jasons Lipshutz also compared Maritnez to Del Rey and
            Lorde, saying , "Martinez is clearly cribbing from the dimly lit pop stylings of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, but
            while her wispy delivery strikes the same femme fatale poses, she lacks the subtlety of her influences", and
            that "Martinez is admirably ambitious, but her insistence on sticking to Cry Baby's central idea leaves her
            contorting into uncomfortable positions". Martinez describers her alter ego and the protagonist of her debut
            album, Cry Baby, as a "fairy tale" version of herself.[99] Martinez's songs are often based on personal
            experiences.[100] Martinez described her own music as "very dark and honest" and "hip hop/trap inspired
            beats with creepy nostalgic childlike sounds such as baby pianos, music boxes, and toys".
